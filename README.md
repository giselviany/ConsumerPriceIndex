Exploring the relationship between economic growth and consumption levels in Asia, focusing on the impact of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on annual inflation using Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression   
●	Identified significant factors influencing annual consumer price inflation, including the dependency ratio and GDP inflation.  
●	Evaluated model performance using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Residual Standard Error (RSE), demonstrating that the WLS regression method provided better fit, and accuracy compared to OLS Model.  
●	Contributed to understanding inflation dynamics in Asia, providing a robust predictive model that can assist policymakers in identifying key factors influencing inflation based on annual CPI data.
